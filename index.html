        <p class="content">
          Everything you do as a designer involves people. When you create products, spaces, or media, you must consider how people will interact with your work. (Lupton, Carpentier &amp; Lambert, 2014). Addressing human needs is often seen as design’s fundamental mission. Be passionate about people – create for them and work with them to build something beautiful.

        <h3 class="heading">Get to know your user.</h3>
        <p class="content">
          Every person is unique, and even as a group, the diversity of the human species is immeasurable. (Story, Mueller &amp; Mace, 1998). This means that a singular design cannot satisfy everyone. Find out the specific information about who your user is, and what they want and desire from the product. The research process is integral for creating and delivering a successful user experience.

        <p class="content">
          The product should be the result of a meticulous and well-executed design process.  This process should not be linear. (Haklay, 2010). Iterate, not once, but many times and take recommendation from designers of other disciplines (Alben, 1996). Test your product with real people. When you come across a problem, go back and redesign the elements that don’t work.

      <div class="fourth-point-content">
        <h3 class="heading">Work with the people you are designing for.</h3>
        <p class="content">
          A designer should start with people – come at the solution from their perspective. User involvement is key and will help you to consider the real-life scenarios the users and products will be in. (Haklay, 2010). Search for the needs and desires of the user that have not yet been met and seek to change this. Strive to enhance the lives of your stakeholders and to discover solutions that are surprising to you.

      <div class="fifth-point-content">
        <h3 class="heading">Take responsibility for what you have created.</h3>
        <p class="content">
          People are constantly interacting with products and services, but it is often forgotten that we as designers, and people, are behind the creation of these designs. When your product works well and the user has a pleasant and fulfilling experience, take pride and credit for what you have achieved. In the same way, if your product fails to meet your users’ needs, take the blame, then strive to improve and build on what you have learnt. (Garrett, 2010).
